# Scaling-GNNs
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular for processing graph-structured data, but they are often difficult to scale to large datasets. This project addresses the challenge of scaling GNNs by exploring a variety of techniques such as sampling, sparse tensor operations, and distributed training.
